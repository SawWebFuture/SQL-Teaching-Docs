What is a database: Any collection of related info - can be stored in anyway.

Computers + Databases = love

Amazon.com (infinite, security, stored on computer) vs Shopping list (10 or 20, not secure, paper):

- Database is everywhere
- Computer are good at managing large amounts of infomation

Database Management Systems (DBMS) = Software program, interact with other databases

- site -> database
- CRUD: Create Read Update Delete
- Two Types, 
-- SQL (organizes in tables and rows, columns, unique key), 
-- nonRelational noSQL (general without table structural) (Key-value stores, douments, graphs, flexible tables)
--- JSON, BLOB, XML, etc.: Mongodb, firebase: No SQL


- Relational Database Management Systems: mySQL, mariaDB
- SQL Structured Query Language
-- standard but not always with all dbs

Queries are requests made to the db managment system for specific info
- more complex makes it harder to get the correct info
- google search is a query
